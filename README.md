## Post-Conflict Growth Model
# Overview

This project simulates economic recovery dynamics in fragile post-conflict economies using an augmented Solow growth framework incorporating:

Physical Capital (K)

Human Capital (H)

Governance/Productivity (A)

Conflict Shocks

Policy Counterfactuals

# Key Questions

Does capital reconstruction restore long-run growth?

Does human capital reform produce stronger recovery?

Is there a threshold level of education investment required for stabilization?

# Main Findings

Capital injection generates temporary recovery but does not reverse long-run decline.

Human capital reform improves long-run trajectory.

A critical education investment threshold exists for sustainable recovery.

# Model Structure

model.py – economic equations

simulation.py – dynamic engine

visualization.py – plotting utilities

sensitivity_analysis.py – parameter robustness tests

analysis.ipynb – experiments and results

# Policy Insight

Sustainable recovery in fragile economies requires structural investment in human capital, not solely physical reconstruction.
